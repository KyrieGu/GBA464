# 1) Take a subset of df, focusing on observations where class ($cla) is "standard" or

#   keep in mind that we usually see mpgs between 10 and 40.
#   Also note: in the variable description, $li should be liter per 100km rather than liter per km.
# 3) Find a way to replace year in dataframe oil ($ye) into up to 2 digit (e.g. 1990 becomes 90, and 2001 becomes 1)
